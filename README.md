# CAGED Chord Quizzer

The purpose of this app is to be a simple tool for guitarists to practice their skills with the ["CAGED" system](https://www.pickupmusic.com/blog/what-is-the-caged-system). The user can choose a number of seconds (between 1 and 10) to give themselves between chord changes. Longer times give the player enough time to think about where the roots of the chord are, and how to prepare their hand for the given shape. As times become shorter, the player must be faster, eventually simulating what it would be like to sightread sheet music. 

Used as part of a daily practice routine, this app will give guitarists a serious "CAGED" workout to help improve their playing quickly.
